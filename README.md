# END-OF-TERM-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-2022-2023
At the end of every term/session, students are usually graded based on their perfomance and adviced on what to do to further improve their studies and come out with better grades in the future
 An anlaysis was run ona data to determine the students' performance for the year 2022/2023 and the following observations were made from the analysis; 

The reading frequency was quite poor which suggests that most of these students have not cultivated the habit of reading, while some of them in grade 7 perormed really well with Grade AA, when compared with students that made Grade DD.

A sigmificant numnbe rof these students (128) have attested to the fact that projects and extracurricular activities have contributed positively to their overall academic success, 4 others think otherwise, 13 were neutral and 7 were indifferent to these observations.

A large proportion of these students were observed to have come from stable homes and families where both parents are together in unity, a very lower portion come from seperated homes and even fewer ones come from home where either or both parents were dead already which on one hand could induce stress on performances academically.

Additionally, taking notes in class was observed not to corresspond to good grades at all times, as observed from the chart thst the highest number of students who take notes in class fall under the Grade 1 category.

Lastly, Type 4 (75%) and Type 3 (50%) scholarship were more prevalent than the other scholarship types which points to the fact that they were more accessible when compared to the other types of scholarship regardless of educational perfomances. 

having noted all of these observations, a few ecommendations were made based off these few points and they are;

The authorities involved in the scholarship scheme are advised to ensure students and parents are well aware of the availability, requirements and application processes for thses scholarship types to increase to increase awareness and application opportunities regardless of what level one might be interested in. 
evaluate the criteria for full scholarship and consider expanding eligibility to provide greater opportunities for everyone especially the less priviledged students.
More sujitable means to inculcate pratcial projects, extra curricular/group activities into their academic calender or schedule to boost their overall learning process and end results.
Students who are negative minded or indifferent should be counselled into the importance of praticals and extra curricular activities.
Moral and financial and parental initiatives should be made available through organizationsfor students who are affected with the above stated observations to strenthen family impacts and values that will eventually boost their interests academically and all spheres of life. 
Educational clubs and supervised reading groups or sessions are to be encouraged to cultivate better reading habits. The tutors should also be more intentional in  making their students understand what thye are being taught in class and not just about copying the notes as it has been observed that copying of notes do not get them to study but are being done to fulfil all righteousness durinmg classes.
